This software is in development phase, current version is VERY BETA. Use at your own risks...
Current versions are stable and can be used but this software is still under development so there could be bugs.

You will also need my repository of utils to be able to compile it. https://github.com/ociviol/Utils

Precompiled binaries available for Linux (x64) and Mac OsX.

	Mac : Just copy the Application in your application folder
	Linux : read the README file (I hope all works well)

requirements :

In order to Build the project you will also need to clone the Utils repository
